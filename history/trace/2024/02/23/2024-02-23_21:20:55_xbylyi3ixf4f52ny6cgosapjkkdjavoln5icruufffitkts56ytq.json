So we could do something like\r\n\r\n``` julia\r\ng = GEOSFP(t)\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Base.:(+)(s::SuperFast, g::EarthSciData.GEOSFP)::ComposedEarthSciMLSystem\r\n    sys = param_to_var(s.sys, :T)\r\n    s = SuperFast(sys, s.rxn_sys)\r\n    ComposedEarthSciMLSystem(\r\n        ConnectorSystem([\r\n            s.sys.T ~ g.sys.I3₊T\r\n        ], s, g),\r\n        s, g,\r\n    )\r\nend\r\nBase.:(+)(f::EarthSciData.GEOSFP, s::SuperFast)::ComposedEarthSciMLSystem = s + g\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code should go in an extension as described here: https://github.com/EarthSciML/AtmosphericDeposition.jl/issues/22. In general to avoid having a huge number of extensions in the EarthSciData package, we can put all the extensions in the other packages, e.g. GasChem.jl in this example case.\r\n\r\nPretty much anything that is currently a parameter with a default value should have a connector to get that information from GEOS-FP.\r\n\r\nAlso add tests.","labels":["gov4git:managed"],"frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"archived":false,"score":{"attention":0},"ref_by":null,"ref_to":null}}}}
